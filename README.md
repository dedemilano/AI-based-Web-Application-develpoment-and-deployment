# flask-app-for-sentiment-analysis
In this project, i used Huggigface transformers library to create an AI powered Python application.
I used nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment (https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment)

This is a bert-base-multilingual-uncased model finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. It predicts the sentiment of the review as a number of stars (between 1 and 5).
